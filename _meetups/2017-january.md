    title: "Isomorphic Clojure Web Apps"
    author: "Brian Hurlow"
    twitter: "bhurlow"
    description: "A talk about techniques for developing websites using isomorphic Clojure code – so Clojure(script) that runs on the jvm and in the browser sharing as much generic code as possible. This opens up areas lots of interesting possibilities for web applications – server-side rendering of React components, lots more code reuse, hot-reloading, this kind of 🔥. Many people have explored these techniques in js, but less so in the Clojure world."
