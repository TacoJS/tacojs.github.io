Refunds offered if:

- the Meetup is cancelled
- the Meetup is rescheduled
- you can cancel at least 7 day(s) before the Meetup

You will be able to request a refund if you cancel at least 7 days in advance of the event. If you want a refund within less of 7 days before the event, you have the option either transferring your ticket OR having your proceeds donated to charity.

Payments you make go to the organizer, not to Meetup.com. You must make refund requests to the organizer.
