## About
TacoJS is a monthly meetup centered around programming, tacos, and live performances. It started when <a href="https://twitter.com/{{ site.data.organizers.first.twitter }}">{{ site.data.organizers.first.name }}</a> wished Philly tech meetups served tacos and discovered <a href="https://wafflejs.com/" target="_blank">WaffleJS</a> &amp; <a href="https://donutjs.club/" target="_blank">DonutJS</a> through a DuckDuckGo search. He was inspired by these events and wanted to organize a Philly technology meetup that would do these things:

- Have attendees actually meet and talk to one another. :wave:
- Promote a diverse and inclusive environment. :heart:
- Get people to have fun. :tada:

Today the meetup is co-organized by {% for organizer in site.data.organizers %}{% if site.data.organizers.last != organizer %}
  <a href="https://twitter.com/{{ organizer.twitter }}" target="_blank">{{ organizer.name }}</a>,{% else %} and <a href="https://twitter.com/{{ organizer.twitter }}" target="_blank">{{ organizer.name }}</a>.{% endif %}{% endfor %} It’s held in Philadelphia every month on a Thursday.

## Sponsorship Package

### $150/month

During the event, sponsors have a chance to talk to attendees in a casual setting. Here are some other things you get with your sponsorship:

- **Stage time**: Two minutes of stage time to do whatever you want with (the more creative the better).
- **Free tickets**: Two tickets for people at your company (please, no recruiters).
- **Swag and merch**: Place to put stickers and swag on the check-in desk or on tables around the venue.
- **Branding**: Featured in the emails to the attendees and shown on the TacoJS site.
- **Opt-in email list**: We ask all attendees whether they’d like to be contacted by sponsors. We’ll share the contact information of those (and only those) who have opted in.
<!-- - **Brunch**: Every three months, we invite sponsors, speakers and performers to have brunch together. -->

(Note: during the first few months of TacoJS, we may adjust the sponsorship package to match the needs of running our meetup. We will give you a month's notice before changing anything, and all leftover funds will always go to non-profits.)

## History
The first session was in July 2016 and it has been held monthly ever since. We use funds to cover the cost of food, the venue, and equipment. **We donate all unused funds each month to non-profits** such as Coded by Kids, Hopeworks, Code for Philly, StudentRND, and GirlDevelopIt.

## Speakers & Attendees
Our past speakers have worked as developers at established companies, as well as smaller startups. Here are a few of those companies:

- Automattic
- Comcast
- Zivtech

<!-- Our attendees are roughly the same ratio of people from larger and smaller companies, leaning toward smaller startups. Around 35% of our attendees are women. -->

## Diversity
We believe this industry can and should be more inclusive. Here are the things we do to make that happen:

- **Donations**: We donate all proceeds to non-profits such as Coded by Kids and GirlDevelopIt.
- **Student sponsorships**: We sponsor students to come to the event so they can meet more people in the industry. So far, we’ve had students from High School, Penn, Temple, and NY Code &amp; Design Academy.
- **Diverse speakers**: We make sure that we have a wide range of speakers at each of our events, with an eye toward gender, racial, and socioeconomic diversity.
