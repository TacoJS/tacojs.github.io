## What’s TacoJS?
TacoJS is a monthly meetup centered around programming, tacos, and live performances.

## How do I submit a talk?
You can either [create a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/TacoJS/talks/issues) or send us an email in the footer link. Come chat in #tacojs on the [PhillyDev Slack](http://phillydev.org/) if you want immediate feedback.

## When and where will it be?
- When: 6:30-9:30pm on a Thursday every month
- Where: Industrious @ Broad/Locust

## Do I need to be an expert to talk?
Nope. This meetup is supposed to be fun and casual, so we want everyone to participate. We especially encourage people of under-represented groups to apply.

## What kind of talks are you looking for?
We don’t have a strict formula and we encourage you to surprise us, but this is the balance we try to strike every month:

### 2x Creative Talks:
Creative applications of programming. Past examples are generating lego murals out of static images, and building an in-browser RPG.

### 1x Passion Talk:
Something you’re excited about outside of work. Past examples are starting and maintaining an open source project, and using meditation and programming side by side.

### 1x Technical Talk:
A deep dive on a technical topic. Past examples are optimizing your code for the V8 JavaScript engine, and using functional programming for developing UI.

## How long should my talk be?
Ten minutes. There won’t be any formal Q&A; we encourage attendees to ask questions in person later. We also try to introduce you well enough so you can speed through any self-bio slides.

## What should be in my talk submission?
Just a few sentences describing what you want to talk about would be great.

## What’s the A/V situation?
We’ll have HDMI to plug into (for video and audio) and a mic for you to use. Let us know if you need any fancy adapters (we’ll have some Apple ones).

## Do I need to submit my slides beforehand?
Nope, but please show up at least 30 minutes before your talk.

## What resolution is the projector?

Our project is widescreen, optimized for 1080x1920 resolutions.
